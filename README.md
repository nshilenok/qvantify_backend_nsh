# qvantify-back
A light backend for qvantify. It takes care of userID creation and handles interviews. It switches topics based on topics table. Note that fields 'sequence' and 'lenght' are required, while 'quit_after' will later be removed. Currently uses projects2, records2 and respondets2 tables instead of the original ones to keep the compatibility with the current approach.
